# SSQEC

## What is it?
SSQEC (Super Simple Quadratic Equation Calculator) is a really rather simple quadratic equation calculator that uses the quadratic formula to compute the result. It is so simple that I'm just going to use The Unlicense to publish it. If anyone needs it, just take it. I don't care.

## Why did I make it?
I've recently gotten a huge interest in math, and wanted a simple project to refresh my Python skills that were just collecting dust for a year now.
